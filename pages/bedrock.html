        <h1>BEDROCK</h1>
        <pre>
        Snowmelt pond   warm granite
        we make camp,
        no thought of finding more.
        and nap
        and leave our minds to the wind.

        on the bedrock, gently tilting,
        sky and stone,

        teach me to be tender.

        the touch that nearly misses—
        brush of glances—
        tiny steps— 
        that finally cover worlds
                    of hard terrain.
        cloud wisps and mists
        gathered into slate blue
        bolts of summer rain.

        tea together in the purple starry eve;
        new moon soon to set,
        why does it take so
        long to learn to
        love,
            we laugh
                and grieve.
        </pre>
