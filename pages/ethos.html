    <h1>Ethos</h1>
    <p>A good website is...</p>
    <h3>Small</h3>
    <p>Actively fight the <a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">web obesity crisis</a>. Avoid large, complex systems. Question every link, include, script or image. If it doesn't actively contribute to the site's purpose or the user's experience, it shouldn't be there.</p>
    <p>Keeping your site small and fast makes it <a href="https://danluu.com/web-bloat/">accessible to more people</a>.</p>
    <h3>Open source</h3>
    <p>Unless you have a very good reason not to, a site's source should be open source. Only by sharing our efforts, ideas and work can we progress to a more open internet.</p>
    <h3>Well documented</h3>
    <p>Code should be modifiable by someone that knows how to program but hasn't seen this particular codebase.</p>
    <h3>Accessible</h3>
    <p>Write semantic HTML. Follow the WCAG 2.0 guidelines. Use aria-attributes when necessary. </p>

    <h3>Unfinished</h3>
    <p>A website is a form of creative expression and allowed to be raw or unfinished. There's no need for every page of the internet to look like a Dribbble shot. The web operated for decades before these kinds of styles were even a thing. Focus on the content.</p>
